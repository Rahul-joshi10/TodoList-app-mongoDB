# TodoList-app-mongoDB
Todolist web app hosted on heroku.
## Main Technologies used:
node.js/express.js, ejs, Mongoose/mongoDB, lodash, Heroku.

## Link: https://rj-todolist.herokuapp.com/
Once you open the app using the above link you can make your own different lists by adding title after "/" in the url
like https://rj-todolist.herokuapp.com/work This will make a new list for work.

## PS
I want to do some improvement in the app that I'll do some day in future, as currently I don't have knowledge to implement those ideas.
